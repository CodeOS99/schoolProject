<!--
    This is a school project. In this project, we had to choose a subject(a topic, I didn't know that so I chose a subject), and create a website. The website must have the following
    - A home page
    - A "purpose" page, which defined the purpose of the website
    - An "applicaiion" page which talked about the applications of the subject/topic
    - A "working principle" which talked about the working principal of the subject/topic
    - A "resources" page, guiding the reader to more advanced heights using other resources
    - A "video" page, which had a video about the subject/topic

    We had to style it as well. I decided to span the website across multiple pages
    I chose "Math" for my subject. We had to choose a specific topic, but I didn't know that
