        <h1 id="title">The Working Principle of Math</h1>
        <p id="description">Mathematics is not merely a static set of rules; it is a dynamic system created by humans to understand and manipulate the abstract concepts of quantity, structure, space, and change.</p>
        
        <h2 id="arithmetic">The Order of Arithmetic</h2>
        <p id="arithmetic-content">Unlike the empirical sciences where observations dictate the rules, mathematics is built upon axioms and logical deductions. If someone said 1 + 1 = 10, that 'one' would sound mentally deranged to us! However, just by changing perpectives, what if the consider the expression in base 10? Then it makes sense... That is what I mean by logical deductions. The order of arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, is a convention established for convenience rather than an objective truth. For instance, while we follow the PEMDAS/BODMAS rule (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), it's essential to understand that this order is arbitrary and chosen to minimize the use of parentheses, making expressions more concise. There is nothing stopping you from doing addition before multiplication, however, the convention is set to this, so we follow it.</p>
        
        <h2 id="number-extensions">Number Extensions</h2>
        <p id="number-extensions-content">Mathematics also involves the extension of numbers from simpler sets to more complex ones. Starting from the concept of whole numbers, mathematics progresses to natural numbers, then rational numbers, real numbers, and even imaginary numbers. Each extension represents a deeper understanding and abstraction of mathematical concepts, allowing us to model and solve increasingly complex problems across various disciplines.<br>
        Let's study them in detail -><br>
        1. Natural numbers are the counting numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. The equation 1 - 1 = <i>x</i> is unsolvable in this system. Thus, let us introduce 0, giving us <br>
        2. Whole numbers, which are the natural numbers and 0. The equation 1 - 1 = 0 is solvable in this system. However, the equation 1 - 2 = <i>x</i> is unsolvable. Thus, let us introduce negative numbers, giving us <br>
        3. Integers, which are the whole numbers and their negatives. The equation 1 - 2 = -1 is solvable in this system. However, the equation 1/2 = <i>x</i> is unsolvable. Thus, let us introduce fractions, giving us <br>
        4. Rational numbers, which are the integers and their fractions. The equation 1/2 = 0.5 is solvable in this system. A rational number is a number in the ratio p/q where p and q are rationals. However, sqrt(2) does not exist in the number set. So, we get<br>
        5. Real numbers, which are the rationals and the irrationals. The equation sqrt(2) = <i>x</i> is solvable in this system. However, the equation x^2 = -1 is unsolvable. Thus, let us introduce the imaginary(yes, you read that correctly, <i>imaginary</i>. Are you starting to believe maths is fun now?) unit, giving us<br>
        6. Complex numbers, which are the reals and the imaginaries. The equation x^2 = -1 is solvable in this system. Thus, we have a number system that can solve all the equations we have encountered so far.<br>
        Of course, I glossed over a LOT of details, and a lot of "properties" are lost as well, from increasing the number systems. In fact, to prove some of the properties we take for granted, we have to delve into complex mathematics!

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p id="conclusion-content">In conclusion, mathematics is a human creationâ€”a testament to our ability to reason, abstract, and innovate. While its foundations may lie in our minds, its applications extend far beyond, shaping the very fabric of reality. By understanding the working principles of mathematics, we not only harness its power for practical purposes but also appreciate the profound beauty and elegance of the language we have crafted.</p>
