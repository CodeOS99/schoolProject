        <h1 id="title">The Applications of Math</h1>
        <p id="description">Mathematics is the language of the universe. It provides us with a powerful tool to understand and describe the world around us. From calculating distances to analyzing data, math plays a crucial role in various fields. Maths is a <b>UNIVERSAL</b> language! It creates a sense of unity amongst people of the world!</bold></p>
        
        <h2 id="importance">Importance of Math</h2>
        <ul id="benefits">
            <li>Problem-solving: Math helps develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This allows for great new heights to be reached! Maths is one of the most perfect ways to utilize problem solving skills!</li>
            <li>Logical reasoning: It trains the mind to think logically and make rational decisions. This helps not only in the case of professionals, but also in the case of regular people, like us. Maths trains us in the art of logical reasoning as well!</li>
            <li>Quantitative analysis: Math enables us to analyze and interpret numerical data. It is utilised in data science, for computer analysis, or by humans in finance andd other sectors.</li>
            <li>Real-world applications: Many professions, such as engineering, finance, and science, astronomy, etc. all heavily and directly rely on Maths. However, most, if not all, professions rely on Maths. For example, the cooking industry relies heavily on science and math. Let's consider a scenario. You are a <i>baker!</i> You have the recipe for one cake. However, you want to make multiple cakes, say, <i>x</i>. Simple! Multiply the ingredients required <i>x</i> times! <b><i>WOAH!</i></b>! Maths!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="education">Mathematics Education</h2>
        <p id="curriculum">Mathematics is an essential part of the education system. It provides a foundation for other subjects and helps students develop analytical and reasoning abilities. Math education focuses on various topics, including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus.<br>
        <b><i>BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MATH IS ABOUT!</i></b>
            Math is much deeper than that. Sure, math is needed for school, but that should not be the reason of you viewing this website(even if it is, I aim to change that throught this website!).
            <br>
            However, it is not entirely right to throw away these reasons either. Maths is <i>crucial</i> for academics, and for higher studies. Basic knowledge of artihmetic is used by people in their daily lives!
    </p>
        
        <h2 id="future">The Future of Math</h2>
        <p id="innovation">As technology advances, math continues to play a vital role in driving innovation. Fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and cryptography heavily rely on mathematical concepts. The future holds exciting possibilities for math and its applications!</p>
